Solution Strategy
=================

DeChat is a Decentralized Chat made with AngularJS and SOLID. DeChat has an _App Component_ and a _Chatroom Component_ made of list of user and feed component. We use _Model-View-Controller_ that is an architectonic pattern for more maintainability. To achieve _quality goal_ we work synergically and divide our works to keep under control the _stability_ and _effectiveness_ of the project. For _maintainability_ and _changeability_  we make sure that everything works testing and comparing our project.

We decided to make this project based on AngularJS and SOLID to be sure of maintainability and decentralization of our project, using a simple layout of components to make it in a easy way for our users, dividing our project in simple projects to affront them in a better way and doing it clearly and simple to understand for changeability and analizability.

_Table 6. Quality goals and solution approaches_

| **Quality Goal** | **Scenario**       | **Solution Approaches** |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Accessibility    | Chatroom Component | Simple layout of components, use of English language, high-light of chat user is in|
|Effectiveness     | App                | Pop-up of new messages, sound of new messages|
|Decentralization  | \\                 | Security of messages based on SOLID, development of a Decentralized Chat|
|Maintainability    |AngularJS           | Synergy of a team and use of AngularJS, divide Problems in smaller ones and find a solution of the problem solving and combining solutions of little problems (Divide-et-Impera)|
|Changeability     | AngularJS          | Use of the same language JavaScript, immutable Objects (User List Component, Chat Component)|
|Analyzability     |Github              | Architectural overview structured according to arc42, detailed documentation of public interfaces|
|Stability         |AngularJS           | Avoid any kind of error writing whole project using AngularJS|
