Building Block View
===================

The main structure of this project consist on dividing the chat in a lot of small parts that will be inside a bigger one. 

Some of this parts will be the different components of the application that will contain the files refered to the user interface and some logic related to that component. There is also a folder intended for the logic that manages the whole interaction between components.

Another important part of the structure is the folder containing the domain model of the application.

![Hierarchy of building blocks](/_docs/images/DiagramPrototype(Doc05).png)

**Level 1** 

In the first level we can divide our application in three blocks:

    - Components
    - Service
    - Model

**Level 2** 

In the second level we focus on the components block to differenciate between the four big parts of the web.

    - Chat
    - Profile
    - Login
    - Settings

Each of these parts is divided into many little components. 

Whitebox Overall System
-----------------------

We divided the code in three big blocks to separate the presentation from the logic and the domain.

 ![Overview Diagram](/_docs/images/DiagramDoc05_2.png)


| Block          | Description |
| ---------------- |----------- |
| Components    | In this block we find the presentation of the web. It is also divided into four blocks that covers the whole application: Profile, Chat, Login and Settings. All the elements that form these blocks have a css, ts and html files  |
| Services | This block manages the logic of the application and the comunication between the presentation and the model |
| Model   | The model covers all the entities that are managed by the application |

Contained Building Blocks

:   *&lt;Description of contained building block (black boxes)&gt;*

Important Interfaces

:   *&lt;Description of important interfaces&gt;*

Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with
name and responsibility according to the following schema:

| **Name**             | **Responsibility**                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Black Box 1          |  *&lt;Text&gt;*                              |
| Black Box 2          |  *&lt;Text&gt;*                              |

If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate
black box template for every important building block . Its headline is
the name of the black box.

### &lt;Name black box 1&gt;

Here you describe &lt;black box 1&gt; according the the following black
box template:

-   Purpose/Responsibility

-   Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs.
    This interfaces may include qualities and performance
    characteristics.

-   (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box,
    e.g.availability, run time behavior, ….

-   (Optional) directory/file location

-   (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to
    requirements).

-   (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

*&lt;Purpose/Responsibility&gt;*

*&lt;Interface(s)&gt;*

*&lt;(Optional) Quality/Performance Characteristics&gt;*

*&lt;(Optional) Directory/File Location&gt;*

*&lt;(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements&gt;*

*&lt;(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks&gt;*

### &lt;Name black box 2&gt;

*&lt;black box template&gt;*

### &lt;Name black box n&gt;

*&lt;black box template&gt;*

### &lt;Name interface 1&gt;

…

### &lt;Name interface m&gt;

Level 2
-------

Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from
level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important
enough to justify such a detailed description. Please prefer relevance
over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or
volatile building blocks. Leave out normal, simple, boring or
standardized parts of your system

### White Box *&lt;building block 1&gt;*

…describes the internal structure of *building block 1*.

*&lt;white box template&gt;*

### White Box *&lt;building block 2&gt;*

*&lt;white box template&gt;*

…
### White Box *&lt;building block m&gt;*

*&lt;white box template&gt;*

Level 3
-------

Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from
level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.

### White Box &lt;\_building block x.1\_&gt;

Specifies the internal structure of *building block x.1*.

*&lt;white box template&gt;*

### White Box &lt;\_building block x.2\_&gt;

*&lt;white box template&gt;*

### White Box &lt;\_building block y.1\_&gt;
