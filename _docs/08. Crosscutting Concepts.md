Cross-cutting Concepts 
======================

**User Experience (UX)**

***User interface***

We cannot just provide a good-looking user interface. We must make it easy to use. Applying the following point is a good recommendation:

*   Use a simple but powerful CSS
*   Keep an eye on contrasts, always taking into account accessibilty problems that can arise
*   Don't put too much buttons and identify them clearly (text, images...)

***Internationalization***

We should look ahead to enlarge language support externalizing strings. But up to this point, English is used through the whole application; it's a good starting point, but we have to look ahead an provide support to another languages with extend use such as Spanish.

**Security & Safety**

User data must be always protected, we can achieve this using HTTPS protocols whenever we send or retrieve data from a POD.

**Under-the-hood**

***Session handling***

We have to keep track of the current active user of the application to store its data. With the solid-auth-client.

***Persistency***

In our case, the persistency is going to be managed by the POD provider such as, for example, Solid Community or Inrupt.
