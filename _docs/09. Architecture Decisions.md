| Architectural decisions        | Judgement                                                    |

| Usage of the rdflib.js         | This library is quite complex to understand but it can provide the necessary tools to manage all the implementation requirements regarding the development of functions interacting with the SOLID PODs. |
| Application of the MVC pattern | In the paper this architectural pattern looks so good used with AngularJS, but it forces us to maintain a very good organization. For example, we cannot mix services with presentation aspects so we have to be careful to keep the code maintainable and scalable at its maximum. |
