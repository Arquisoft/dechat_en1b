Quality Scenarios
-----------------

***Testability/Coverage***

By using [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) ensure code coverage of at least 75%. This is done through the implementation of tests in each component (.spec.ts files) and executing them with the Karma test runner.

***Maintainability***

By using [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com) ensure that the project has at least a "B" mark. Using good practices (no code repetition, code according to the standards...) when coding will make the application easier to maintain. Also the use of divide our problems in little problems helped us to maintain better our code.

***Efficency***

By using [Angular](https://angular.io/) ensure that our project is efficent and has a good performance.

***Accesibility***
Our project has a simple layout and a simple method to use it in order to be an easy app to use. The App has an intuitive use thanks to the colours, the label used for message components and user components.
