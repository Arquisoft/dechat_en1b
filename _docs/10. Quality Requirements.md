Quality Scenarios
-----------------

***Testability/Coverage***

By using [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) ensure code coverage of at least 75%. This is done through the implementation of tests in each component (.spec.ts files) and executing them with the Karma test runner.

***Maintainability***

By using [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com) ensure that the project has at least a "B" mark. Using good practices (no code repetition, code according to the standards...) when coding will make the application easier to maintain.
