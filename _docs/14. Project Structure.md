# Project Structure

The goal of this document is to list all the different folders and files in the project with its functionality.

## _docs

It contains all the markdown code used to generate the documentation following the arc42 template. It also contains an "images/" folder to store all the images used. The "SUMMARY" file is used by gitbook as TOC.

## e2e

It contains all the e2e tests (using Cucumber). It has 3 main folders inside "src/":

* features/: Cucumber test cases
* page_objects/: utilities used for testing (navigation, click...)
* steps/: actual source code that combines page objects with the test cases following the structure defined in the features/"file" associated

In addition it also has two files for configuration:

* protractor.conf.js: the configuration for the Protactor test runner
* tsconfig.e2e.json: has as parent tsconfig.json, and it's the configuration of the Typescript compiler

## node_modules

(Included in .gitignore)

All the local dependencies.

    * solid-profile.model.ts: user's profile model
    * solid-provider.model.ts: SOLID provider model
    * solid-session.model.ts: user's session model
    * user.model.ts: user model
  * services/:
    * auth.guard.service.ts: service that controls the access to the different routes in the app
    * chat.service.ts: service that communicates the app with SOLID using the rdf.service.ts
    * chat.service.spec.ts: test for the service
    * rdf.service.ts: interacts with SOLID posting and getting data
    * solid.auth.service.ts: used to login and logout and to show the login popup
  * popup.html: HTML SOLID login popup 
* assets/: all the static resources of the app such as libraries, types or images
* environments: build configurations for different environments (production, development...)
* locale/: all the internationalization files in XLIFF format.
* browserslist: determines CSS compatibilities with different browsers
* favicon.ico: the main icon of the app
* index.html: base html where the root of the app is placed (app-root)
* karma.conf.ts: configuration file for the Karma test runner, in this case for unit testing
* main.ts: loads everything and controls the startup of the application
* polyfills.ts: determines specific scripts for browser compatibilities
* styles.css: general CSS stylesheet of the application
* test.ts: loads everything and controls all the functionalities regarding the tests, such as loading the TestBed (test context for execution)
* tsconfig.app.json: has as parent tsconfig.json, and it's the configuration of the Typescript compiler for the app
* tsconfig.spec.json: has as parent tsconfig.json, and it's the configuration of the Typescript compiler for the tests
* tslint.json: has as parent tsconfig.json, and it's the configuration of the Typescript linter of the app
* xliffmerge.json: configuration file used for managing the .xlf files regarding internationalization (to merge the new ones and the old ones when calling the command to detect new strings to be internationalized)

## Others (in the root)

* .editorconfig: general configuration for the IDE (encoding, tabulation...)
* .gitignore: to exclude files when uploading to Git

* book.json: gitbook configuration file, in this case for the theme
* LICENSE: license of the project, in this case MIT
