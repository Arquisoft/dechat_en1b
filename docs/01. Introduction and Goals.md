Introduction and Goals
======================

This aim of this project is to create a decentralized chat based on the SOLID framework to allow users to always control their data and thus their privacy.

Requirements Overview
---------------------

The whole project is based on the [solid specification](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec). And the basic requirements are the following ones:

* The system will be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app
* Users can store their chat data in their own PODs (Personal Object Data)
* The app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or other kinds of files with other friends through the chat
* A user can get notifications when some friend wants to chat with him
* Users can have groups of friends with whom they may want to chat
* It will be possible to have group chats where all members receive the messages

The idea of a decentralized chat is so important because nowdays privacy is something to take into account. If a user has complete access to its data with no intermediary, we can ensure that all of its information would not be compromised.

Quality Goals
-------------
_Table 1. Quality Goals_

| Priority | Quality          | Motivation |
| -------- | ---------------- |----------- |
| 1        | Effectiveness    | User should be able to comunicate with others properly using all the functionalities available. |
| 2        | Decentralization | According the functional requirements, we will use SOLID to protect user data. |
| 3        | Maintanability   | Using AngularJS with its default architectonical pattern Model-View-Controller, testing, revising and extending funcionalities it's easier. |
| 4        | Accessibility    | Using good practices and color combinations, most people should be able to use it. |
