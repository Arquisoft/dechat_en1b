Architecture Constraints
========================

**Contents.**

Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of
design and implementation decisions or decision about the development
process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and
are valid for whole organizations and companies.

**Motivation.**

Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design
decisions and where they must adhere to constraints. Constraints must
always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

**Form.**

Simple tables of constraints with explanations. If needed you can
subdivide them into technical constraints, organizational and political
constraints and conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines,
documentation or naming conventions)

**Tables containing the architeture constraints and their descriptions**


1.-Technical Constraints:

| Constraints                 | Explanation                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Descentralized Architecture | Data storage must be separated separated from the app       |
| SOLID Specifications        | The app must follow the SOLID specifications                |

2.-Organizational Constraints:

| Constraints     | Explanation                                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Team components | The system will be developed by teams of 5-8 students |

3.- Political Constraints:

| Constraints                | Explanation                                                                                                                                 |

| Architecture documentation | Structure based on the english arc42-Template                                                                                               |
| Language                   | English. The project and the corresponding blog targets an international audience,  so English should be used throughout the whole project. |
