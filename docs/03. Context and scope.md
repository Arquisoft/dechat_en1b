System Scope and Context
========================

Here we will describe the partners involved in the environment of the decentralized chat


Business Context
----------------
![Business Context Diagram](images/03-business-context.png "Business Context Diagram")
**Contents.**

Specification of **all** communication partners (users, IT-systems, â€¦)
with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication
protocols.

**Motivation.**

All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the
environment of the system.

**Form.**

All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify
the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table. The title of the
table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of
the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

**&lt;Diagram or Table&gt;**

**&lt;optionally: Explanation of external domain interfaces&gt;**


Technical Context
-----------------

**Contents.**

Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your
system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific
input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which
channel.

**Motivation.**

Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical
interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure
or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

**Form.**

E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels
and input/output.

**&lt;Diagram or Table&gt;**

**&lt;optionally: Explanation of technical interfaces&gt;**

**&lt;Mapping Input/Output to Channels&gt;**
