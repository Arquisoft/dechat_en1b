Solution Strategy
=================

**Contents.**

DeChat is a Decentralized Chat made with AngularJS and SOLID. DeChat has an _App Component_ and a _Chatroom COmponent_ made of list of user and feed component. We use _Model-View-Controller_ that is an architectonical pattern for more maintanability. To achieve _quality goal_ we work synergically and divide our works to keep under control the _stability_ and _effectiveness_ of the project. For _maintanability_ and _changeability_  we make sure that everything works testing and comparing our project.

**Motivation.**

We decided to make this project based on AngularJS and SOLID to be sure of maintanability and decentralization of our project, using a simple layout of components to make it in a easy way for our users, dividing our project in simple projects to affront them in a better way and doing it clearly and simple to understand for changeability and analizability. 

**Form.**

| **Quality Goal** | **Scenario**       | **Soution Approaches** |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Accessibility    | Chatroom Component | Simple layout of components,Use of English language, High-light of chat user is in|
|Effectiveness     | App                | Pop-up of new messages, Sound of new messages|
|Decentralization  | \\                 | Security of messages based on SOLID, Development of a Decentralized Chat|
|Maintanability    |AngularJS           | Synergy of a team and use of AngularJS, DIvide Problems in smaller ones and find a solution of the problem solving and combining solutions of little problems (DIvide-et-Impera)|
|Changeability     | AngularJS          | Use of the same language JavaScript, Immutable Objects (User List Component, Chat Component)|
|Analyzability     |Github              | Architectural overview structured according to arc42, Detailed documentation of public interfaces|
|Stability         |AngularJS           | Avoid any kind of error writing whole project using AngularJS|
