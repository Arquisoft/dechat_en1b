Solution Strategy
=================

**Contents.**

A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and
solution strategies, that shape the systemâ€™s architecture. These include

-   technology decisions

-   decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g.
    usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern

-   decisions on how to achieve key quality goals

-   relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development
    process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

**Motivation.**

These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are
the basis for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

**Form.**

Keep the explanation of these key decisions short.

Motivate what you have decided and why you decided that way, based upon
your problem statement, the quality goals and key constraints. Refer to
details in the following sections.
