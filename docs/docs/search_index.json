Introduction and Goals.html","title":"Introduction and Goals","keywords":"","body":"Introduction and Goals\nThis aim of this project is to create a decentralized chat based on the SOLID framework to allow users to always control their data and thus their privacy.\nRequirements Overview\nThe whole project is based on the solid specification. And the basic requirements are the following ones:\n\nThe system will be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app\nUsers can store their chat data in their own PODs (Personal Object Data)\nThe app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or other kinds of files with other friends through the chat\nA user can get notifications when some friend wants to chat with him\nUsers can have groups of friends with whom they may want to chat\nIt will be possible to have group chats where all members receive the messages\n\nThe idea of a decentralized chat is so important because nowadays privacy is something to take into account. If a user has complete access to its data with no intermediary, we can ensure that all of its information would not be compromised.\nQuality Goals\nTable 1.

For maintainability and changeability  we make sure that everything works testing and comparing our project.\nWe decided to make this project based on AngularJS and SOLID to be sure of maintainability and decentralization of our project, using a simple layout of components to make it in a easy way for our users, dividing our project in simple projects to affront them in a better way and doing it clearly and simple to understand for changeability and analizability.\nTable 6.

To exchange messages with the selected user we have to click on his contact but he also have to add us as a friend and click on ours. If the user tries to send a message to a contact that hasn't added him or hasn't clicked on his contact he will get a message notifying him.\nThe steps to be able to send messages to a friend are the following: \n\nThe user clicks on a friend on his friends list.\nThis creates a folder in the user's pod to store the conversation with that user.\nThe user waits for the user to do the same.\nWhen the folders on the corresponding pods are created the conversation is ready\n\nOnce the conversation has been opened succesfully, both users can send messages to each other by typing on the textfield at the bottom of the chat and pressing 'Enter' or pressing the button 'Send'. \nThe sent messages will contain the name of the sender, the date of the message and the content.\nWhen the user clicks on a conversation that already have messages, he will read the received messages.\nSettings\nIn the Settings view we will be able to add and remove friends. \nIf we want to add a friend we have to select the provider of his account and write his username. \nIf we want to remove a friend, we have to write his card url.\nAdding a friend:\n\nWrite your friend's username in the text field.\nOpen the combobox and select the provider of your friend's account.\nIf the option selected is 'Other', a new text field will appear and you have to write the provider's name.\nClick on 'Add friend' button.\n\nRemoving a friend:\n\nWrite your friend's card url.\nClick on the 'Remove' button.\n\n\nHelp\nThis view won't have any functionality but it will suport some usefull information for the user.\n\nProfile\nThe profile view will be oritented to update the user's information.

Experimentation.html","title":"Experimentation","keywords":"","body":"Experimentation\nGoal of this document\n\nList all the different experiments we did in order to choose the technologies\nDescribe what we have learned\n\nExperiments\nThe idea of the experiments was to create a simple front-end oriented web application that could mimic the functionality of a simple chat. Sending messages, having different chat rooms, logging... It is important to mention that we did not implement ant back-end functionality, but we left a \"gap\" for it in the future to be completed. For instance, an empty angular service that just returns a hard-coded array of JSON objects with the messages.\nWe used three different metrics to test its value as a potential technology:\n\nSimplicity: how many lines of codes were needed to develop the app, and the readability of that code.\nModularity capabilities: we have divided our team in front-end and back-end developers, so if the technology allows us to divide easily the different layers of the architecture, that would be a huge advantage.\nLearning curve: since the dev team has little to no experience with developing this kind of projects we had to balance the time needed to learn the basics and the time it saves by simplifying developing.\n\n\n\n\nPlugin\nDescription\nSimplicity\nModularity\nLearning curve\n\n\n\n\nHTML & Javascript\nJust a very simple barebone web app\nThe code becomes very messy (1)\nLow (2)\nZero\n\n\njQuery\nWildly used Javascript library that simplifies DOM interaction\nThe simplest\nLow\nLow\n\n\nAngularJS\nNode.js Framework for developing SPAs (Single Page Applications)\nIntermediate (3)\nTotal (MVC)\nHigh\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nSpecially since the DOM access and modification needs to be programmed just using basic Javascript calls.\nSince there is no inherent architecture to just plain Javascript and HTML, besides separating the \"View\" in the HTML and the \"Controller\" in the Javascript code.\nI mean this because while the code becomes cleaner in terms of DOM access, managing the framework can be daunting at first. Of course, this is written from the perspective of someone that is new to AngularJS.\n\nResults & thoughts\nAt the end, we have decided to use AngularJS. Although angular has a steep learning curve it is a very powerful framework. Besides, we have found way more documentation for AngularJS with SOLID than with any other technology.\n(Note)\nSadly, we did not commit all the experiments to this repository.
