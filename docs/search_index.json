Introduction and Goals.html","title":"Introduction and Goals","keywords":"","body":"Introduction and Goals\nThis aim of this project is to create a decentralized chat based on the SOLID framework to allow users to always control their data and thus their privacy.\nRequirements Overview\nThe whole project is based on the solid specification. And the basic requirements are the following ones:\n\nThe system will be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app\nUsers can store their chat data in their own PODs (Personal Object Data)\nThe app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or other kinds of files with other friends through the chat\nA user can get notifications when some friend wants to chat with him\nUsers can have groups of friends with whom they may want to chat\nIt will be possible to have group chats where all members receive the messages\n\nThe idea of a decentralized chat is so important because nowadays privacy is something to take into account. If a user has complete access to its data with no intermediary, we can ensure that all of its information would not be compromised.\nQuality Goals\nTable 1. Quality Goals\n\n\n\nPriority\nQuality\nMotivation\n\n\n\n\n1\nEffectiveness\nUser should be able to communicate with others properly using all the functionalities available.\n\n\n2\nDecentralization\nAccording the functional requirements, we will use SOLID to protect user data.\n\n\n3\nMaintainability\nUsing AngularJS with its default architectonic pattern Model-View-Controller, testing, revising and extending funcionalities it's easier.\n\n\n4\nAccessibility\nUsing good practices and color combinations, most people should be able to use it.\n\n\n\nStakeholders\nThe following lists contains the most important people for this application:\nTable 2.

DeChat has an App Component and a Chatroom Component made of list of user and feed component. We use Model-View-Controller that is an architectonic pattern for more maintainability. To achieve quality goal we work synergically and divide our works to keep under control the stability and effectiveness of the project. For maintainability and changeability  we make sure that everything works testing and comparing our project.\nWe decided to make this project based on AngularJS and SOLID to be sure of maintainability and decentralization of our project, using a simple layout of components to make it in a easy way for our users, dividing our project in simple projects to affront them in a better way and doing it clearly and simple to understand for changeability and analizability.\nTable 6.

To exchange messages with the selected user we have to click on his contact but he also have to add us as a friend and click on ours. If the user tries to send a message to a contact that hasn't added him or hasn't clicked on his contact he will get a message notifying him.\nThe steps to be able to send messages to a friend are the following: \n\nThe user clicks on a friend on his friends list.\nThis creates a folder in the user's pod to store the conversation with that user.\nThe user waits for the user to do the same.\nWhen the folders on the corresponding pods are created the conversation is ready\n\nOnce the conversation has been opened succesfully, both users can send messages to each other by typing on the textfield at the bottom of the chat and pressing 'Enter' or pressing the button 'Send'. \nThe sent messages will contain the name of the sender, the date of the message and the content.\nWhen the user clicks on a conversation that already have messages, he will read the received messages.\nSettings\nIn the Settings view we will be able to add and remove friends. \nIf we want to add a friend we have to select the provider of his account and write his username. \nIf we want to remove a friend, we have to write his card url.\nAdding a friend:\n\nWrite your friend's username in the text field.\nOpen the combobox and select the provider of your friend's account.\nIf the option selected is 'Other', a new text field will appear and you have to write the provider's name.\nClick on 'Add friend' button.\n\nRemoving a friend:\n\nWrite your friend's card url.\nClick on the 'Remove' button.\n\n\nHelp\nThis view won't have any functionality but it will suport some usefull information for the user.\n\nProfile\nThe profile view will be oritented to update the user's information.

Applying the following point is a good recommendation:\n\nUse a simple but powerful CSS\nKeep an eye on contrasts, always taking into account accessibility problems that can arise\nDon't put too much buttons and identify them clearly (text, images...)\n\nInternationalization\nWe should look ahead to enlarge language support externalizing strings. But up to this point, English is used through the whole application; it's a good starting point, but we have to look ahead an provide support to another languages with extend use such as Spanish.\nSecurity & Safety\nUser data must be always protected, we can achieve this using HTTPS protocols whenever we send or retrieve data from a POD.\nUnder-the-hood\nSession handling\nWe have to keep track of the current active user of the application to store its data.

It's simple, intuitive and fast. Here you can find more info.\n\n\nAngular component\nIs a special kind of directive that uses a simpler configuration which is suitable for a component-based structure. This makes it easier to write an app in a way that's similar to using Web Components or using the new Angular's style of application architecture. All the components are linked with each other using a Component Router.\n\n\nAngularJS\nNode.js framework created by Google designed to build powerful SPAs. Here's a link to the official page.\n\n\nFOAF\n\"Friend Of A Friend\"angul), a RDF vocabulary we use to represent the social links between SOLID users.\n\n\nLinked Data\nIt is the way SOLID connects different POD's resources. Those links are typed, this means that they contain additional information.\n\n\nMVC\n\"Model View Controller\", AngularJS framework architecture. It separates the logic, data, and user interface into different modules.\n\n\nNode.js\nAn execution environment for Javascript built with the Javascript V8 motor of Chrome.

Experimentation.html","title":"Experimentation","keywords":"","body":"Experimentation\nGoal of this document\n\nList all the different experiments we did in order to choose the technologies\nDescribe what we have learned\n\nExperiments\nThe idea of the experiments was to create a simple front-end oriented web application that could mimic the functionality of a simple chat. Sending messages, having different chat rooms, logging... It is important to mention that we did not implement ant back-end functionality, but we left a \"gap\" for it in the future to be completed. For instance, an empty angular service that just returns a hard-coded array of JSON objects with the messages.\nWe used three different metrics to test its value as a potential technology:\n\nSimplicity: how many lines of codes were needed to develop the app, and the readability of that code.\nModularity capabilities: we have divided our team in front-end and back-end developers, so if the technology allows us to divide easily the different layers of the architecture, that would be a huge advantage.\nLearning curve: since the dev team has little to no experience with developing this kind of projects we had to balance the time needed to learn the basics and the time it saves by simplifying developing.\n\n\n\n\nPlugin\nDescription\nSimplicity\nModularity\nLearning curve\n\n\n\n\nHTML & Javascript\nJust a very simple barebone web app\nThe code becomes very messy (1)\nLow (2)\nZero\n\n\njQuery\nWildly used Javascript library that simplifies DOM interaction\nThe simplest\nLow\nLow\n\n\nAngularJS\nNode.js Framework for developing SPAs (Single Page Applications)\nIntermediate (3)\nTotal (MVC)\nHigh\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nSpecially since the DOM access and modification needs to be programmed just using basic Javascript calls.\nSince there is no inherent architecture to just plain Javascript and HTML, besides separating the \"View\" in the HTML and the \"Controller\" in the Javascript code.\nI mean this because while the code becomes cleaner in terms of DOM access, managing the framework can be daunting at first. Of course, this is written from the perspective of someone that is new to AngularJS.\n\nResults & thoughts\nAt the end, we have decided to use AngularJS. Although angular has a steep learning curve it is a very powerful framework. Besides, we have found way more documentation for AngularJS with SOLID than with any other technology.\n(Note)\nSadly, we did not commit all the experiments to this repository. However, the first 5 commits or so were the AngularJS experiment, to anyone interested.\n"},"About arc42.html":{"url":"About arc42.html","title":"About arc42","keywords":"","body":"About arc42\narc42, the Template for documentation of software and system\narchitecture.\nBy Dr. Gernot Starke, Dr. Peter Hruschka and contributors.\nTemplate Revision: 7.0 EN (based on asciidoc), January 2017\n© We acknowledge that this document uses material from the arc 42\narchitecture template, http://www.arc42.de. Created by Dr. Peter\nHruschka & Dr. Gernot Starke.\n\nNote\nThis version of the template contains some help and explanations. It\nis used for familiarization with arc42 and the understanding of the\nconcepts. For documentation of your own system you use better the\nplain version.  \n\n1. Introduction and Goals\nShort description of the requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract) of requirements. Top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture which have highest priority for the major stakeholders. A table of important stakeholders with their expectation regarding architecture.\n2. Architecture Constraints\nAnything that constrains teams in design and implementation decisions or decision about related processes. Can sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.\n3. Context and scope\nDelimits your system from its (external) communication partners (neighboring systems and users). Specifies the external interfaces. Shown from a business/domain perspective (always) or a technical perspective (optional).\n4. Solution Strategy\nSummary of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies that shape the architecture. Can include technology, top-level decomposition, approaches to achieve top quality goals and relevant organizational decisions.\n5. Building Block View\nStatic decomposition of the system, abstractions of source-code, shown as hierarchy of white boxes (containing black boxes), up to the appropriate level of detail.\n6. Runtime View\nBehavior of building blocks as scenarios, covering important use cases or features, interactions at critical external interfaces, operation and administration plus error and exception behavior.\n7. Deployment View\nTechnical infrastructure with environments, computers, processors, topologies. Mapping of (software) building blocks to infrastructure elements.\n8. Crosscutting Concepts\nOverall, principal regulations and solution approaches relevant in multiple parts (→ cross-cutting) of the system. Concepts are often related to multiple building blocks. Include different topics like domain models, architectur patterns and -styles, rules for using specific technology and inmplementation rules.\n9. Architecture Decisions\nImportant, expensive, critical, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.\n10. Quality Requirements\nQuality requirements as scenarios, with quality tree to provide high-level overview. The most important quality goals should have been described in section 1.2. (quality goals).\n11. Risks and Technical Debt\nKnown technical risks or technical debt. What potential problems exist within or around the system? What does the development team feel miserable about?\n12. Glossary\nImportant domain and technical terms that stakeholders use when discussing he system.
