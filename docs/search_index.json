Introduction and Goals.html","title":"Introduction and Goals","keywords":"","body":"Introduction and Goals\nThis aim of this project is to create a decentralized chat based on the SOLID framework to allow users to always control their data and thus their privacy.\nRequirements Overview\nThe whole project is based on the solid specification. And the basic requirements are the following ones:\n\nThe system will be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app\nUsers can store their chat data in their own PODs (Personal Object Data)\nThe app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or other kinds of files with other friends through the chat\nA user can get notifications when some friend wants to chat with him\nUsers can have groups of friends with whom they may want to chat\nIt will be possible to have group chats where all members receive the messages\n\nThe idea of a decentralized chat is so important because nowdays privacy is something to take into account. If a user has complete access to its data with no intermediary, we can ensure that all of its information would not be compromised.\nQuality Goals\nTable 1. Quality Goals\n\n\n\nPriority\nQuality\nMotivation\n\n\n\n\n1\nEffectiveness\nUser should be able to comunicate with others properly using all the functionalities available.\n\n\n2\nDecentralization\nAccording the functional requirements, we will use SOLID to protect user data.\n\n\n3\nMaintanability\nUsing AngularJS with its default architectonical pattern Model-View-Controller, testing, revising and extending funcionalities it's easier.\n\n\n4\nAccessibility\nUsing good practices and color combinations, most people should be able to use it.\n\n\n\nStakeholders\nThe following lists contains the most important people for this application:\nTable 2.

For maintanability and changeability  we make sure that everything works testing and comparing our project.\nMotivation.\nWe decided to make this project based on AngularJS and SOLID to be sure of maintanability and decentralization of our project, using a simple layout of components to make it in a easy way for our users, dividing our project in simple projects to affront them in a better way and doing it clearly and simple to understand for changeability and analizability. \nForm.\n\n\n\nQuality Goal\nScenario\nSoution Approaches\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nChatroom Component\nSimple layout of components,Use of English language, High-light of chat user is in\n\n\nEffectiveness\nApp\nPop-up of new messages, Sound of new messages\n\n\nDecentralization\n\\\nSecurity of messages based on SOLID, Development of a Decentralized Chat\n\n\nMaintanability\nAngularJS\nSynergy of a team and use of AngularJS, DIvide Problems in smaller ones and find a solution of the problem solving and combining solutions of little problems (DIvide-et-Impera)\n\n\nChangeability\nAngularJS\nUse of the same language JavaScript, Immutable Objects (User List Component, Chat Component)\n\n\nAnalyzability\nGithub\nArchitectural overview structured according to arc42, Detailed documentation of public interfaces\n\n\nStability\nAngularJS\nAvoid any kind of error writing whole project using AngularJS\n\n\n\n"},"05. Building Block View.html":{"url":"05. Building Block View.html","title":"Building Block View","keywords":"","body":"Building Block View\nContent.\nThe building block view shows the static decomposition of the system\ninto building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,\ninterfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers,\nfunctions, macros, operations, datas structures, …) as well as their\ndependencies (relationships, associations, …)\nThis view is mandatory for every architecture documentation. In analogy\nto a house this is the floor plan.\nMotivation.\nMaintain an overview of your source code by making its structure\nunderstandable through abstraction.\nThis allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract\nlevel without disclosing implementation details.\nForm.\nThe building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and\nwhite boxes (see figure below) and their descriptions.\n\nLevel 1 is the white box description of the overall system together\nwith black box descriptions of all contained building blocks.\nLevel 2 zooms into some building blocks of level 1. Thus it contains\nthe white box description of selected building blocks of level 1,\ntogether with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.\nLevel 3 zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.\nWhitebox Overall System\nHere you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the\nfollowing white box template. It contains\n\nan overview diagram\n\na motivation for the decomposition\n\nblack box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these\nwe offer you alternatives:\n\nuse one table for a short and pragmatic overview of all\ncontained building blocks and their interfaces\n\nuse a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks\naccording to the black box template (see below). Depending on\nyour choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text\nfiles), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling\ntool).\n\n\n\n(optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the\nblack box templates of a building block, but are very important for\nunderstanding the white box. Since there are so many ways to specify\ninterfaces why do not provide a specific template for them. In the\nworst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics,\nprotocols, error handling, restrictions, versions, qualities,\nnecessary compatibilities and many things more. In the best case you\nwill get away with examples or simple signatures.\n\n\n\nMotivation\n:   \nContained Building Blocks\n:   \nImportant Interfaces\n:   \nInsert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:\nIf you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with\nname and responsibility according to the following schema:\n\n\n\nName\nResponsibility\n\n\n\n\nBlack Box 1\n\n\n\nBlack Box 2\n\n\n\n\nIf you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate\nblack box template for every important building block . Its headline is\nthe name of the black box.\n\nHere you describe  according the the following black\nbox template:\n\nPurpose/Responsibility\n\nInterface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs.\nThis interfaces may include qualities and performance\ncharacteristics.\n\n(Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box,\ne.g.availability, run time behavior, ….\n\n(Optional) directory/file location\n\n(Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to\nrequirements).\n\n(Optional) Open issues/problems/risks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\nLevel 2\nHere you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from\nlevel 1 as white boxes.\nYou have to decide which building blocks of your system are important\nenough to justify such a detailed description.

Experimentation.html","title":"Experimentation","keywords":"","body":"Experimentation\nGoal of this document\n\nList all the different experiments we did in order to choose the technologies\nDescribe what we have learned\n\nExperiments\nThe idea of the experiments was to create a simple front-end oriented web application that could mimic the functionality of a simple chat. Sending messages, having different chat rooms, logging... It is important to mention that we did not implement ant back-end functionality, but we left a \"gap\" for it in the future to be completed. For instance, an empty angular service that just returns a hard-coded array of JSON objects with the messages.\nWe used three different metrics to test its value as a potencial technology:\n\nSimplicity: how many lines of codes were needed to develop the app, and the readability of that code.\nModularity capabilities: we have divided our team in front-end and back-end developers, so if the technology allows us to divide easily the different layers of the arquitecture, that would be a huge advantage.\nLearning curve: since the dev team has little to no experience with developing this kind of projects we had to balance the time needed to learn the basics and the time it saves by simplifying developing.\n\n\n\n\nPlugin\nDescription\nSimplicity\nModularity\nLearning curve\n\n\n\n\nHTML & Javascript\nJust a very simple barebone web app\nThe code becomes very messy (1)\nLow (2)\nZero\n\n\njQuery\nWildly used Javascript library that simplifies DOM interaction\nThe simplest\nLow\nLow\n\n\nAngularJS\nNode.js Framework for developing SPAs (Single Page Applications)\nIntermediate (3)\nTotal (MVC)\nHigh\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nSpecially since the DOM access and modification needs to be programmed just using basic Javascript calls.\nSince there is no inherent architecture to just plain Javascript and HTML, besides separating the \"View\" in the HTML and the \"Controller\" in the Javascript code. \nI mean this because while the code becomes cleaner in terms of DOM access, managing the framework can be daunting at first. Of course, this is written from the perspective of someone that is new to AngularJS.\n\nResults & thoughts\nAt the end, we have decided to use AngularJS. Although angular has a steep learning curve it is a very powerful framework. Besides, we have found way more documentation for AngularJS with SOLID than with any other technology.\n(Note)\nSadly, we did not commit all the experiments to this repository. However, the first 5 commits or so were the AngularJS experiment, to anyone interested.\n"},"About arc42.html":{"url":"About arc42.html","title":"About arc42","keywords":"","body":"About arc42\narc42, the Template for documentation of software and system\narchitecture.\nBy Dr. Gernot Starke, Dr. Peter Hruschka and contributors.\nTemplate Revision: 7.0 EN (based on asciidoc), January 2017\n© We acknowledge that this document uses material from the arc 42\narchitecture template, http://www.arc42.de.
