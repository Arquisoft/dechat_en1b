And the basic requirements are the following ones:\n\nThe system will be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app\nUsers can store their chat data in their own PODs (Personal Object Data)\nThe app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or other kinds of files with other friends through the chat\nA user can get notifications when some friend wants to chat with him\nUsers can have groups of friends with whom they may want to chat\nIt will be possible to have group chats where all members receive the messages\n\nThe idea of a decentralized chat is so important because nowadays privacy is something to take into account. If a user has complete access to its data with no intermediary, we can ensure that all of its information would not be compromised.\nQuality Goals\nTable 1.

But up to this point, English is used through the whole application; it's a good starting point, but we have to look ahead an provide support to another languages with extend use such as Spanish.\nSecurity & Safety\nUser data must be always protected, we can achieve this using HTTPS protocols whenever we send or retrieve data from a POD.\nUnder-the-hood\nSession handling\nWe have to keep track of the current active user of the application to store its data.

Experimentation.html","title":"Experimentation","keywords":"","body":"Experimentation\nGoal of this document\n\nList all the different experiments we did in order to choose the technologies\nDescribe what we have learned\n\nExperiments\nThe idea of the experiments was to create a simple front-end oriented web application that could mimic the functionality of a simple chat. Sending messages, having different chat rooms, logging... It is important to mention that we did not implement ant back-end functionality, but we left a \"gap\" for it in the future to be completed. For instance, an empty angular service that just returns a hard-coded array of JSON objects with the messages.\nWe used three different metrics to test its value as a potential technology:\n\nSimplicity: how many lines of codes were needed to develop the app, and the readability of that code.\nModularity capabilities: we have divided our team in front-end and back-end developers, so if the technology allows us to divide easily the different layers of the architecture, that would be a huge advantage.\nLearning curve: since the dev team has little to no experience with developing this kind of projects we had to balance the time needed to learn the basics and the time it saves by simplifying developing.\n\n\n\n\nPlugin\nDescription\nSimplicity\nModularity\nLearning curve\n\n\n\n\nHTML & Javascript\nJust a very simple barebone web app\nThe code becomes very messy (1)\nLow (2)\nZero\n\n\njQuery\nWildly used Javascript library that simplifies DOM interaction\nThe simplest\nLow\nLow\n\n\nAngularJS\nNode.js Framework for developing SPAs (Single Page Applications)\nIntermediate (3)\nTotal (MVC)\nHigh\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nSpecially since the DOM access and modification needs to be programmed just using basic Javascript calls.\nSince there is no inherent architecture to just plain Javascript and HTML, besides separating the \"View\" in the HTML and the \"Controller\" in the Javascript code.\nI mean this because while the code becomes cleaner in terms of DOM access, managing the framework can be daunting at first. Of course, this is written from the perspective of someone that is new to AngularJS.\n\nResults & thoughts\nAt the end, we have decided to use AngularJS. Although angular has a steep learning curve it is a very powerful framework. Besides, we have found way more documentation for AngularJS with SOLID than with any other technology.\n(Note)\nSadly, we did not commit all the experiments to this repository. However, the first 5 commits or so were the AngularJS experiment, to anyone interested.\n"},"About arc42.html":{"url":"About arc42.html","title":"About arc42","keywords":"","body":"About arc42\narc42, the Template for documentation of software and system\narchitecture.\nBy Dr. Gernot Starke, Dr. Peter Hruschka and contributors.\nTemplate Revision: 7.0 EN (based on asciidoc), January 2017\n© We acknowledge that this document uses material from the arc 42\narchitecture template, http://www.arc42.de.
